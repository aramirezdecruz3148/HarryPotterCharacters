1. add a homepage that is split half for spell half for characters
4. add links in both headers for home, characters, spells
5. see if I can't make both characters/spells searchable by using some array methods?
    -can't seem to find a solution that has the best of both worlds that will allow me to load
    all the data and update it on button click, was using sortedContactList build
    as a reference for creating a possible component callback/method
    -was able to get something like this to kind of work
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            spells.filter(spell => {
                if(spell.spell.includes(input.value)) {
                    const spellItem = new SpellItem({ spell });
                    list.appendChild(spellItem.render());
                }
            });
<<<<<<< HEAD
         });
I have learned that it is possible to use .filter() to make the spells 
searchable, but need to think more about data flow between components,
and also might wanna think about putting it into a form so I can make it
reset-able, or adding a reset button?

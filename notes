    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            spells.filter(spell => {
                if(spell.spell.includes(input.value)) {
                    const spellItem = new SpellItem({ spell });
                    list.appendChild(spellItem.render());
                }
            });
         });
I have learned that it is possible to use .filter() to make the spells 
searchable, but need to think more about data flow between components,
and also might wanna think about putting it into a form so I can make it
reset-able, or adding a reset button?
//what about putting the filtering of spells in a modal!!!!!!

1. add a homepage that is split half for spell half for characters
4. add links in both headers for home, characters, spells
5. see if I can't make both characters/spells searchable by using some array methods?
    -can't seem to find a solution that has the best of both worlds that will allow me to load
    all the data and update it on button click, was using sortedContactList build
    as a reference for creating a possible component callback/method
    -was able to get something like this to kind of work
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            spells.filter(spell => {
                if(spell.spell.includes(input.value)) {
                    const spellItem = new SpellItem({ spell });
                    list.appendChild(spellItem.render());
                }
            });
         })

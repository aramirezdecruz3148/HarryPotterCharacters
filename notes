1. should add the ability to search by name for both pages
3. add a homepage that is split half for spell half for characters
4. add links in both headers for home, characters, spells
5. see if I can't make both characters/spells searchable by using some array methods?
    -was able to get something like this to kind of work
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            spells.filter(spell => {
                if(spell.spell.includes(input.value)) {
                    const spellItem = new SpellItem({ spell });
                    list.appendChild(spellItem.render());
                }
            });
         });

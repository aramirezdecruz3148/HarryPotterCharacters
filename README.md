# Harry Potter Character/Spell Directory #

I created this project as a directory and resource for all characters and spells within the Harry Potter universe. The character directory provides details on each characters' school, house, and blood status as well as the ability to filter all characters based on house, blood status and group affiliation (D.A, Death Eater, etc). The spell directory provides a list of all spells in alphabetical order that appear within the 7 books of the Harry Potter series. For each spell you are given the type (charm, hex, curse, etc) and the effect of the spell.
